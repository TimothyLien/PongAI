# PongAI
Classic Pong Game with an AI opponent
Hello, this is a project that I completed for my highschool CSA project.
The ipynb file was used to train the model and does not need to be ran in order to play the game. The model has already been saved in the sb_models.zip file. 
Before running the PongAITesting.py file, please install all the libraries that are being imported in the code.
*Note: Install this version of stable baselines for the code to work "pip install git+https://github.com/carlosluis/stable-baselines3@fix_tests"
